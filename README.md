# \## Getting the Site Live (GitHub Pages Setup)

# 

# To host this site yourself using GitHub Pages:

# 

# 1\.  Head over to the \*\*Settings\*\* tab in your GitHub repository.

# 2\.  Click on \*\*"Pages"\*\* in the left menu.

# 3\.  Under "Build and deployment", choose \*\*"Deploy from a branch"\*\*.

# 4\.  Select the \*\*`main`\*\* branch from the dropdown and make sure the folder is set to the \*\*`/(root)`\*\* directory.

# 5\.  Hit \*\*"Save"\*\*.

# 6\.  Give it a few minutes to build. GitHub will then show you the live URL!

# \## What I Learned From This Project

# 

# This exercise helped me get hands-on experience with a few key concepts:

# 

# \*   Structuring HTML: Getting a better feel for using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to organize the page properly.

# \*   Modern CSS: Practicing layout with both Flexbox (for the navigation and hero section) and CSS Grid (for the two-column project and skills lists).

# \*   Making it Responsive: Using media queries to make sure the site looks good on both my desktop and my phone.

# \*   The GitHub Flow: Getting comfortable with `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and understanding how GitHub Pages works for deployment.
